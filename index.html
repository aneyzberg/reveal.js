          <h2>Proof of Work</h2>


          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>Blocks get added through the chain by mining</li>
                <li>proof of work</li>
                <li>In bitcoin the service string is encoded in the block header data structure, and includes a version field,
                  the hash of the previous block, the root hash of the merkle tree of all transactions in the block, the current time, and the difficulty.</li>
                  <li>Version (4 bytes)
                      Hash of the previous block, thus making a chain of block (32 bytes)
                      Merkle root, the tree of transactions' reference (32 bytes)
                      Timestamp, number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 (4 bytes)
                      Bits, a representation of the networks current difficulty (4 bytes)
                      Nonce, incremented when mining (4 bytes)</li>
                <li>so when miners mine a block - they use the blockheader and a nonce - and a nonce (randomg value) that is hashed to try and find proof of work</li>
                <li>A blockchain consists of a number of blocks that are linked with each other with each block linked with its previous block.</li>
                <li>and, each block consists of a batch of timestamped transactions and a hash of previous block. As the blocks are linked with each other forming a chain,
                  hence the name of the database.</li>
                  <li>once found block, it communicates to network. If block is valid other nodes add it, and</li>
                  <li>incentivizes nodes to be good actors</li>
                <li>incentives people to contribute</li>
                <li>The mechanism behind proof of work was a breakthrough in the space
                  because it simultaneously solved two problems.
                  First, it provided a simple and moderately effective consensus algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree
                  on a set of canonical updates to the state of the Bitcoin ledger. Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process,
                  solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing sybil attacks.</li>
                <li> It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as the requirement to be registered as a unique entity on a particular list,
                  with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings.</li>

            Introducing GenServer

                <li>
                  OTP provides us a behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation.

                <li>developers are only required to impement the ones they need</li>
                <li>Genserers also allow us to maintian state</li>
